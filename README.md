# Oh My Shell


A framework based on [Oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) and
[bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it). There are lots of scripts and
tools available which don't work well in zsh. **Oh my shell** is designed to keep
bash in sync with your zsh environment, meaning when you have to use bash it
shouldn't be so bad :)

### Install

`oh-my-shell` Should work with any recent release of zsh and bash.

### curl
```
curl -O "https://raw.github.com/NeuralSandwich/oh-my-shell/master/tools/install.sh"
```

### wget
```
wget "https://raw.github.com/NeuralSandwich/oh-my-shell/master/tools/install.sh"
```

### Why not help out?
Lots of people love Zsh and Bash. Hopefully with your help we can create a
framework that allows for all these cool features for both shells.
